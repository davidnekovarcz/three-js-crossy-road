# Crossy Road with React Three Fiber

A 3D endless runner game inspired by Crossy Road, built with React Three Fiber. Navigate through procedurally generated levels, avoid obstacles, and collect corn to save your progress!

## 🎮 How to Play

### Objective
- **Survive as long as possible** by crossing obstacle lanes and avoiding moving objects
- **Collect corn (🌽)** to create checkpoints and save your progress
- **Score points** by advancing through rows - your score is based on how far you've traveled

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys** or **On-screen buttons** to move:
  - `↑` (Up Arrow) - Move forward
  - `↓` (Down Arrow) - Move backward  
  - `←` (Left Arrow) - Move left
  - `→` (Right Arrow) - Move right

### Game Mechanics

#### 🌽 Corn Collection System
- **Corn appears in forest areas** - look for the golden corn scattered throughout the level
- **Each corn you collect**:
  - Creates a checkpoint at your current position
  - Plays a satisfying collection sound
  - Shows up in your corn counter (top-right corner)
  - **Saves your progress** - if you get hit, you'll respawn at your last corn checkpoint!

#### 🚧 Obstacle System
- **Getting hit by obstacles** (wooden logs or colored balls):
  - If you have corn: You lose 1 corn and respawn at your last checkpoint
  - If you have no corn: Game Over! You'll need to restart from the beginning
- **Visual feedback**: Your character shakes when hit, and you'll hear horn sounds

#### 🎯 Scoring
- Your score increases as you advance through rows
- The further you go, the higher your score
- Try to beat your personal best!
